* Bank Loan Dashboard & Analysis
>This project showcases my data analysis and dashboarding skills using real-world loan data.

* Project Discription
> In this this project i focuses on analyzing loan performance data for a bank using SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel. It includes KPI generation, cohort performance tracking, and loan segmentation by various demographic and financial attributes. The goal is to deliver data-driven insights to assist the bank in understanding loan issuance trends, repayment behavior, and customer segmentation.

* Objectives
>Extract and aggregate key metrics like total loan applications, funded amounts, interest rates, and defaults using SQL.

>Build dynamic and interactive dashboards using Power BI, Tableau, and Excel.

>Provide monthly, state-wise, and category-wise breakdowns.

>Generate business insights such as:

>Good vs. Bad loan trends

>Impact of loan term and employment length

>Monthly and state-level funding trends
